## 🚀 Project Overview

Customer churn is a major challenge in the telecom industry.  
This project helps identify customers who are likely to leave the service by analyzing:

- Call usage behavior  
- Data consumption  
- Billing patterns  
- Complaint frequency  
- Customer tenure  

A **Random Forest Classifier** is trained to predict churn and highlight high-risk users.
